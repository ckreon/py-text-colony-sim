A turn-based text colony simulator!

## How to Run

Requires: Python 3.x
From CLI: from the project directory, run `python main.py`
From GUI: from the project directory, Double-Click the `main.py` file

## Gameplay Basics

Assign workers to roles to generate resources:
- Farmers generate a base of 3 food per turn
- Doctors generate a base of 3 health per turn
- Lumbers generate a base of 4 wood per turn
- Miners generate a base of 2 iron and 1 gold per turn

Use negative numbers to remove workers from roles.

Population Growth is driven by the number of Free Population.

The game features a "Calamity Engine" that will influence all resource outcomes, including birthrate.

Survival is mainly dependent on proper worker allocation.

## Gameplay Tips

For a quick population boost, don't assign workers for the first turn or two.
