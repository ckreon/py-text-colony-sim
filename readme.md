## Gameplay Basics

Assign workers to roles to generate resources:
- Farmers generate a base of 3 food per turn
- Doctors generate a base of 3 health per turn
- Lumbers generate a base of 4 wood per turn
- Miners generate a base of 2 iron and 1 gold per turn

Use negative numbers to remove workers from roles.

Population Growth is driven by the number of Free Population.

Survival is mainly dependent on proper worker allocation.

For a quick population boost, don't assign workers for the first turn or two.
